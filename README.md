wa77cher is an app to collect some shitposting stats.   
It consists of a discord bot, a scheduled web scraper and a database.  
Its purpose is solely shitposting and should not be used anywhere in public since its functionality violates TOS of Discord.  

The main reason I did this was to test a proper setup of a .netcore c# project with discord bot & database managed by efcore - that worked pretty neat :)
